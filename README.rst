Collecting Ohai Data into Server Density
========================================

Ohai is an easy way to add a bunch of new metrics to your Server Density monitoring.

Installation
************

- Install the ohai gem on your servers with `gem install ohai`
- Go to http://plugins.serverdensity.com/list/
- Click "Install" on the Ohai plugin
- Follow the install instructions

Usage
*****

Ohai provides a number of metrics out of the box, but most of them are already provided by the default metrics.

The real advantage of using the Ohai plugin is to access data from any plugins you've written or installed. You can learn more about writing Ohai plugins in the Opscode wiki: http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Writing+Ohai+Plugins
